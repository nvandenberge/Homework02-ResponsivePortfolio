          My name is Nick and I am a Software Engineer currently living in
          Baltimore, MD. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information
          Systems from Stevenson University. While working as a Software Support
          Specialist between 2015 - 2019 I found myself growing interest in how
          the software was developed. I began self-studying web development in
          my spare time and decided to officially commit to it in 2018 when I
          took an 8-week coding bootcamp in Baltimore. In 2019 I started
          developing part-time for the same organization I was working for by
          working on small bugs and features while maintaining my position as a
          Software Support Specialist. In 2020 I was promoted to full-time
          Software Engineer. 
          <br />
          <br />
          After working as a Software Engineer for 6 months, I was provided me
          the opportunity to learn more about full-stack development by taking a
          24-week coding bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University to learn more
          about back-end technologies interact with front-end. In my free time,
          I like to study full-stack development, exercise, and play video games
          with friends. I am very passionate about Web Development, and strive
          to better myself as a developer.
